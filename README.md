# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Pushing changes to GitHub

Since this environment doesn't directly support pushing to GitHub, you will need to:

1.  **Download the project:**  Download the project as a zip file.
2.  **Initialize a Git repository:** In your local environment, create a new Git repository or use an existing one.
3.  **Copy project files:** Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file into your local Git repository.
4.  **Commit and push:** Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.
